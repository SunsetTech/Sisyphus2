Sisyphus: An attempt to produce syntax-safe templating

requires my "Moonrise" library, must be installed in lua path as "Sisyphus2"

Sisyphus is a self-modifying grammar capable of templating any of its own grammar which is not related to the definition of templates.
Currently however, the grammar isn't much, and to be truly useful it needs to be "bound" to some other language, and a few features on the todo list must be implemented.
Evaluation is "partialazy", template definitions will be partially evaluated and what cannot be evaluated(due to the presence of variables) will be semi-lazily evaluated at invocation time

Full language is demonstrated through the test files under Grammar/Tests
Invoke the tests like:
	lua[jit] Process.lua Path/To/Input Path/To/Output

The interesting bits are under:
	Interpreter/Execution.lua
	Interpreter/Parse/Dynamic.lua
	Grammar/Types/Basic/Template/

Todo:
	Syntax error reporting (might be hard)
	I believe the grammar contains some issues particularly around alias selection
	Forward declaration and mutual recursion
	Template overloading?
	Templated parses (to support a form of specialization for templates)
	Lazier evaluation

	Templates as structs:
		Template A<Data.String Argument> Templates.Functions.Join<:Input "!">
		Template B<A Argument> Templates.Functions.Join<:A.Argument ::A>

	Support for some language as example, probably Lua, maybe C too
		Templating a language would look like this:
			Template DefineTestFunction<Lua.Name Name> Lua.Function.Definition function :A() return "Test" end
			Template ExtractFunctionName<Lua.Function.Definition Function> Lua.Name :Function.Name
			Later in some Lua code:
				function NormallyDefined()
					return "Test"
				end
				:DefineTestFunction TemplateDefined --[[function TemplateDefined() return "Test" end]]

				
	There are some slight bugs I've identified
	Investigate syntax highlighting, suspect it may not be possible, or not possible safely
	Far off: Optimize run time, currently abysmal
		A major problem is the amount of objects created. the main test case "Input" consumres hundreds of MB with the GC off
	Further off: A compiler (should be possible, naively we could compile template definitions to Lua)
	Find a better name?
	Cleanup
	Description of how execution works
